# Regular expression in Perl format.
# Free attribute "r" is a string represenation of regex object.
# It starts and ends with slash (e.g. "/(your-pattern)/s"),
# Also it can be specified by the flag option,
# e.g. (QQ.txt.regex "/(word)/i").compile.matches "WORD".
# other flags:
# /d - Enables Unix lines mode.
# /i - Enables case-insensitive matching.
# /x - Permits whitespace and comments in pattern.
# /m - Enables multiline mode.
# /s - Enables dotall mode.
# /u - Enables Unicode-aware case folding.
#
